            <h2>Nearly everything you need to know about mental health.</h2>
            <h2>The Basics of Mental Health</h2>
            <h3>What is Mental Health?</h3>
            <p>Mental health is our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It is how we think, feel, and act. It helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Just like our physical health, it is important to all people at any age group.</p>
            <h3>Mental Health Is... </h3>
            <p>Mental illnesses are conditions that affect a person's thinking, feeling, mood, or behavior in a way that impairs their ability to relate to others and function each day. Examples include MDD (depression) and schizophrenia. Poor mental health and mental illness are not the same thing. A person can experience poor mental health and not be diagnosed with a mental illness. Likewise, a person diagnosed with a mental illness can experience periods of good physical, mental, and social well-being.</p>
            <h3>Why is mental health important for overall health?</h3>
            <p>Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health. Mental illness, especially depression, increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like stroke, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk factors and exacerbate the symptoms of mental illnesses like Depression or Bipolar Disorder.</p>
